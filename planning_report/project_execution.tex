\section{Project Execution}

Since the team is spread out geographically, there will be weekly Skype meetings together with our supervisors. These meetings will serve as a status update between the team members and a chance for the supervisors to give feedback on the current state and planned work.

The work coordination will be managed with Slack and some form of
issue/story tracking, for example Trello or Github.

\subsection{Time Plan}

\begin{itemize}
